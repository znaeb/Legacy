changes from part1: 
Lots of functionality converted to JS/Jquery. 
Raptorized!! 
DB works properly, and is awesome!!!!! (I showed this to you in class). 
Sorted folders.
Cleaned up code.

If there was a third part to this project, I would like to implement flex into my code.
In between parts 1 and 2, I learned how to use Javascript, and I think it's SUPER useful! (I enjoy being able to modify code while it's in use XD). 
I liked this project, because it gave me a place to REALLY use all that I learned for a single (silly) purpose!
My project in particular could have been better if Passover wasn't during finals week, and I could have made more changes.

PS. I Loved your class, and learned a lot (I knew no PHP/HTML/JS before-hand). I think you are a really fun teacher (but not so fun that I'd want to repeat the class :P). Have a great summer!
